* Grade of 70 to 79 is a C  
* Grade of 60 to 69 is a D 
* Grade of 59 or below is a F

## For loop
### Fibonacci sequence: 

* Write a program that prints the first 20 elements of Fibonacci sequence: 

* Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, and the first two elements are 0 and 1

* it starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..

### squares of numbers
* using for loop print the squares of numbers from 1-10 

## Nested for loop
### Multiplication table
